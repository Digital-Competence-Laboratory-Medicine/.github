## Digital competence in laboratory medicine

Welcome to the GitHub page of the "Digital Competence in Laboratory Medicine" initiative. We want to bring together young scientists and doctors and develop a digital skillset together.

We are working on developing our skills in the following areas:
- Markdown language
- Collaborative working
- R and RStudio
- Git and GitHub
- Python
- Machine Learning
- Deep Learning

How do we want to achieve these goals?
- Regular online sessions with
  - tutorials
  - IT buzzword bingos (8 - 10 minutes presentation about a IT buzzword)
- Using this GitHub organization to work together on coding projects and to dicuss issues
- Using other ressources like [Cryptpad](https://cryptpad.fr/) to get familiar with collaborative working tools

If you have any questions, you can contact us at any time: digcomplabmed@ifcc.org
